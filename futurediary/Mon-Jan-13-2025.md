# CGPA / OFFCAMPUS

My cgpa is too less rn - its 8.1 ,decent but my clg is filled with 9s.  
so I guess trying offcampus is the Bushido rn !

P.S: That is the inspiration behind me trying to boost myself on internet like making a website.. trying to get famous on X , yt, insta etc...  
BTW its been 20 years since I came to Earth .. [Time to evolve]
