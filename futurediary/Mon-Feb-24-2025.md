# git-filter-repo 

[CS]

I commited an API to github [publicly] and wanted to remove that . <br> 
At first I thought of removing the whole repo [deleting it] <br>
Then I found this CLI tool <pre>[git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo)</pre> which helps you to rewriter history .<br> 

<br><br>
I commited my Gemini API key in [here](github.com:surajk013/hotel-management-system) on gen part [which is for the AI part]
<br><br> I did rewrite , Lemme k if you find any keys there [thanks]. <br>
so now I don't need to delete the repo.<br>
