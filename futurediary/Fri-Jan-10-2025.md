# Reflecting

It's been 5 years since 2020 -- I feel like I have lost in the time, not moving forwards ... Time to shift the gear.
so now I will be pulling out some clutch moments of my life .. its time to bring up some peak prime to level up the life a little bit cuz........ 
in a few hours .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>I will turn 20 ! <br> 
P.S: can't believe my life.
