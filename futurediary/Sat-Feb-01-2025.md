# Study - FUN 

Highly recommend - silicon valley to CS students and `gintama` <br><br>

<br><br>other recommendations<br><br>


I just came across this thing called as `a manga guide to` it has so many topics and they are acutally a manga scene guide like a pov of manga and they explain very engineered topics like calculus , logistic regression, statistics , databases, universe . <br> Just try downloading it at [universe](https://pdfroom.com/books/the-manga-guide-to-the-universe/jGk208rl2pm).

P.S: I want to tag my blog with a particular tags - so you can just read the ones that you like - lets see that - added to todo list <br>

Oh yeah bugswriter just commented on my video 5 days ago - I had internals - so couldn't check mails - here [comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKtCIGUz_lY&lc=UgxNrIwJNasDCpRGJ5Z4AaABAg&ab_channel=Warlord13)/



! [ IMPORTANT ] some [CS stuff below]

about that systemd - I created 3 - for zram , for cpuGovernor , and for enableCpuBoost. <br> 
- **zram** get the swap to how much ever you want , will talk about this some day later. <br>
- **cpuGovernor** This is the most interesting thing <br> I actually had heating issues with my new laptop [acer a325-42 octa core ]. And so I booted to windows , and it was pretty silent <br> I went on a lil deep and discovered `cpupower`  there I got to know about governors 


>  - `powersave` most power efficient <br> 
> - `conservative` can increase the performance when necessary slowly <br>
> - `ondemand` can increase the performance aggresively on demand <br>
> - `userspace` only uses the specified cpu frequency set by the user <br>
> - `schedutil` works in batch as the resources are demanded the cpu power just keeps increasing without any conern for power and only for performance [ the older ones main concern was power ].<br>
> - `perofrmance` gives peak performance using the cpu's core to its highest available frequency . <br>

- **enableCpuBoost** This is used to enable the cpu limit to as much as speciifed by the hardware vendor. you can even surpass the limit [overclocking] . That is exactly opposite is what I do - cuz I need my pc to come in a long run . Overclocking has exactly the issues I don't wanna face at their best possible harm rate - heating issue. 


This cpupower is acutally `very powerfull`. Use it with high caution. <br>
Don't play with it <br>
