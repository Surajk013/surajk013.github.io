# Reflect in order to be grateful 
Uninstalling bloat is actually very important . I did it last when I was preparing for my college exntrance exams . IDK why I stopped. But now I understand again that I have responsibilities and need to make a meaning out of my life.<br> 20 years feels so much meaning less to me /feels/ , guiltiness sorta that I am not enough grateful to what I have<br> so I decided that I will be making world a **better place** to live , that way maybe tomorrow I might not feel guilty and that would be a way to show gratitude to my life. <br>
P.S: I have no idea how I am going to make world a better place , maybe that is something to look forward, maybe that is why I will be getting more time here on Earth. . . . .
