so my laptop had auto-cpufreq running , which I wasn't aware of and I was trying to change back the cpu governors and boost state - but it always reverted back .<br>
After trying to debug for a long time , I figured to check the pacman logs and yay logs to remember what I downloaded regarding my cpu , cuz I got heating issues in my lappy. <br>

I just remembered about auto-cpufreq and it did the work just as the name suggested - as soon as I disabled it I was able to change the governors and boost state <br><br>

Both my laptop and desktop only support full clock speed when the driver is the manufacturer of the cpu . <br>
      At the same time that driver <b>does not</b> support other drivers such as "conservative" "ondemand" "shedutil" etc <br>
