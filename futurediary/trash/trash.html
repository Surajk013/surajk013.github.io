<br>These are philosophies/rules that I once thought were good/helpful. <br>


But no. This DOES NOT work , philosophies . . rules . . just <b>DOESN'T MATTER</b>. <br>


<blockquote>There are no rules</blockquote><br>
 
Even I once thought that these philosophies and rules / way of life existed.<br>
 
So the following are a few ideologies that I came up with back then.<br> 
 
Before you read : <br>

Remember as much satisfying or true as they feel | they just <b>don't matter</b><br>
 
<em> No USE </em>

Continuing the previous philosophy. Since there are no emotions to deal with - there are no attachments and the focus can be made **without** any distractions . This kind of focus helps to achieve anything in life. I have a real life example -  . <br><br>

what exactly is bloat? <br><br>
<br> <a href="Sun-Jan-12-2025.html"> Reflect in order to be grateful </a><br>
<span class="tag philosophy">[Philosophy]</span><br>
Uninstalling bloat is actually very important . I did it last when I was preparing for my college exntrance exams . IDK why I stopped. But now I understand again that I have responsibilities and need to make a meaning out of my life. 20 years feels so much meaning less to me /feels/ , guiltiness sorta that I am not enough grateful to what I have so I decided that I will be making world a **better place** to live , that way maybe tomorrow I might not feel guilty and that would be a way to show gratitude to my life. <br><br>

Since, Reality is an illusion . And I am anyways 100% detached from everything , there are no distractions. <br><br>
